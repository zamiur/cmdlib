Uses and Introduction
----
cmdlib can be used for a variety of purposes. At the moment this is a small project with a few examples and files, hoping that people would be intrested in contributing.

Setting up developer enviroment
----
To program a batch script with cmdlib there is not much to set up other than having a:
 - text editor (Notepad, Notepad++, write.exe, MS-DOS Editor, Programmer's Notepad etc)
 - If you want you could use an IDE such as Visual Studio
 - Command Prompt (or any alternative such as [cmder](http://cmder.net/))
 - A compiler (to convert to an .EXE and is completely **optional**)
 
 Once your developer enviroment has been set up, you can start programming by first making a project folder (to store the batch file, other miscallenous files etc.)
